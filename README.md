## My project is created to classify and predict the credible credit card clients based on the classic and advanced machine learning methods. 

## Statement problems: how does the probability of default payment vary by categories of different demographic variables? Which variables are the strongest predictors of default payment? How do we predict the credit card clients may lead to default of credit card? 

## The idea is to use the “Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset” from UCI Machine Learning, and applied it in different machine learning models and compared the performance of these two models. 

## The dataset was collected by I-Cheng Yeh, and it contains the information on default payment, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

## My goal is to predict the credible clients based on the default credit card payment and figure out which model would predict the results more accurate.


## Dataset: 25 variables and 30,000 observations

## Appendix:

•	ID: ID of each client
•	LIMIT_BAL: Amount of given credit in NT dollars (includes individual and family/supplementary credit
•	SEX: Gender (1=male, 2=female)
•	EDUCATION: (1=graduate school, 2=university, 3=high school, 4=others, 5=unknown, 6=unknown)
•	MARRIAGE: Marital status (1=married, 2=single, 3=others)
•	AGE: Age in years
•	PAY_0: Repayment status in September, 2005 (-1=pay duly, 1=payment delay for one month, 2=payment delay for two months, ...   8=payment delay for eight months, 9=payment delay for nine months and above)
•	PAY_2: Repayment status in August, 2005 (scale same as above)
•	PAY_3: Repayment status in July, 2005 (scale same as above)
•	PAY_4: Repayment status in June, 2005 (scale same as above)
•	PAY_5: Repayment status in May, 2005 (scale same as above)
•	PAY_6: Repayment status in April, 2005 (scale same as above)
•	BILL_AMT1: Amount of bill statement in September, 2005 (NT dollar)
•	BILL_AMT2: Amount of bill statement in August, 2005 (NT dollar)
•	BILL_AMT3: Amount of bill statement in July, 2005 (NT dollar)
•	BILL_AMT4: Amount of bill statement in June, 2005 (NT dollar)
•	BILL_AMT5: Amount of bill statement in May, 2005 (NT dollar)
•	BILL_AMT6: Amount of bill statement in April, 2005 (NT dollar)
•	PAY_AMT1: Amount of previous payment in September, 2005 (NT dollar)
•	PAY_AMT2: Amount of previous payment in August, 2005 (NT dollar)
•	PAY_AMT3: Amount of previous payment in July, 2005 (NT dollar)
•	PAY_AMT4: Amount of previous payment in June, 2005 (NT dollar)
•	PAY_AMT5: Amount of previous payment in May, 2005 (NT dollar)
•	PAY_AMT6: Amount of previous payment in April, 2005 (NT dollar)
•	default.payment.next.month: Default payment (1=yes, 0=no)
